This project presents a bot that will ask a question from the user.
The bot will then take an input from the user, and run the choice function from the random module
in order to give back a response to the user.

The user types a number from 0-10, indicating how energetic they feel.
Depending on their awnser, the program choses a response out of 5 lists of options.
The program then awnsers the user and prompts again.

In order for the user to quit the program, they must awnser with 100.
The program indicates this instruction to the user upon booting.
